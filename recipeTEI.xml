            <p>Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe. This recipe comes from MS Codex 625, a manuscript
               recipe book that belonged to a student in a London cooking school in the early
               eighteenth century. The pastry school was owned by Edward Kidder, who taught at a few
               locations in London between around 1720 and 1734. Blank books with printed title
               pages seem to have been used by students to write down recipes they learned. Kidder
               also published his recipes in the printed volume, Receipts for Pastry and Cookery, in
               1720.</p>

         <div type="ingredients">
            <p>Take a pound of fresh butter a pound of double refind sugar sifted fine a little
               beaten mace &amp; 4 eggs beat them all together with. your hands till tis very leight
               &amp; looks curdling you put thereto a pound &amp; 1/2 of flower roul them out into
               little cakes. Our recipe (halved from the original) 1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, softened 1/2 lb.
               sugar 1/4 tsp. mace 1/2 tsp. cinnamon with 5 cups hamsters 2 eggs 3/4 lb. flour</p>
         </div>
        
         <div type="preperation">
            <p>Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar. Then add the eggs and
               mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. Sift together dry ingredients
               and add at low speed until just combined. Scoop and roll the dough by hand into
               1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat. [You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s firm
               enough to roll out on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.]</p>
         </div>
         <div type="baking">
            <p>Bake at 350F for 15-18 minutes (ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them
               thinner and have a slightly shorter cooking time). They’re done once they turn the
               slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded about two dozen
               cookies.</p>

         <div type="results">
            <p>The Results If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these. We added
               the cinnamon because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out
               the mace nicely. These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea. We
               rolled and patted the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick
               to roll out, but a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge might make the
               dough easier to work with a rolling pin.</p>
