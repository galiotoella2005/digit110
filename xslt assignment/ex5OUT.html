               </p>
            <p>
               The Manoir de Bécheron is a private home which welcomes a few paying 
               guests.  It is a rambling 15th-16th Century house situated in the peaceful 
               valley of the Indre in the heart of the Chateaux de la Loire region.  The  
               furniture is authentic Renaissance and 18th Century.  The Manoir has an 
               air of Old World charm with modern comfort.  The cuisine is French, meals 
               are 'en famille', except for breakfast, which is served in your room or, 
               if you choose, in the gardens.
               </p>
            <p>
               You are one of us when we go visiting our French and American 
               neighbors.  Among them are such famous artists as Alexander Calder, Max 
               Ernst and A. Ozenfant.
               </p>
            <p>
               Bécheron is 25 kilometers from Tours, which can be reached by rail 
               from Paris in about two and half hours.  Of course we meet you at the 
               station.
               </p>
            <p>
               The rate in high-season (June 15-August 31) is $15 a day or $100 
               a week per person all inclusive (room, bath, 3 meals, wines, liqueurs, 
               coffee and service).  This includes the local excursions around Bécheron 
               such as Saché, Azay-le-Rideau, Tours, Langeais.  The Saché Museum now 
               houses a permanent exhibit of the sculpture of my father, Jo Davidson.  
               The off-season rate (March 1-June 14; Sept. 1-October 31) is $10 a day 
               or $65 a week per person.  Contrary to the usual continental practice 
               there are no extra charges at Bécheron.
               </p>
            <p>
               My French wife and I have two children, Eva age 12 and Laurent who 
               is 5; we can and do care for children, and you will find they are never 
               underfoot.  If you should want a place where you can safely leave yours 
               while touring Europe, Bécheron is the place you are looking for.  Our 
               children were born in the United States and speak French and English as 
               of course we do.
               </p>
            <p>
               A week in Bécheron is over before you realize it!  You won't want to 
               miss the thrilling sight of the illuminated chateaux; they alone are 
               worth the trip.  The 'Sleeping Beauty' castle of Ussé, Azay-le-Rideau, 
               famous Chenonceau and Chambord are but a few of the fabulous palaces 
               which surround us.
               </p>
            <p>
               During one of your outings we will picnic in the Forêt de Loches near 
               a circular 12th Century chapel, or on the banks of the Loire across from 
               Mme. de Pompadour's palace at Ménars.  We will also take you to one of the 
               outstanding restaurants of Tours on a picturesque medieval square.
               </p>
            <p>
               We are looking forward with pleasure to meeting you, with or without 
               your children.  We'll be glad to answer any specific question you may have.  
               Write to us.
               </p>
            <p>
               Cordially yours,

            <p>
               Harriet had stayed in Greenwich over night so went in 
               town with us. Wm drove the station wagon with our 
               bags.Very cleverlym selected as we had two suiuit 
               cases each and a "bottle bag and the typewriter-plus 
               a very unhealthy looking green duffle bag (reserved for 
               purchases. THIS folded up on thebbottem of a suit case 
               for future use!
               </p>
            <p>
               State room gay with flowers and champagne. We had 
               a send off party. Billy was hiding behind a curtain 
               and was a HUGE surprise ' Carlyl had arranged it this way 
               Gail's mother and a friend- Dale and Kissy got to the 
               dock just after 10.30 and were not allowed to come on 
               board. Too bad.
               </p>
            <p>
               Huge ship. Like a section of the Waldorf- the 
               Peacock Alley plus several of the dining rooms- afloat 
               Streams of PEOPLE mu ing about.
               </p>
            <p>
               We had a table in the dining room with 5 other femal 
               ladies. Thought it would divert us. The one man looked 
               us over and next meal he wasn't there. So we dr4ewano 
               another lady. It all proved to be amusing. We exchange 
               addresses and werephotographed to-gether.
               </p>
            <p>
               Voyage very smooth all way over. We took in the 
               movies and pools. I won a few dollars on a pool.
               </p>
            <p>
               A Mr and Mrs Andeson, very nice friends of H. 
               and Caryls asked us for cocktails one evening. Then 
               there were the parties of the Captain and the Purser 
               Also Esther Boyer was on board with a party of eight 
               in cabin class, she was to steer about over Europe. 
               She came upand had tea with us one day.
               </p>
            <p>
               The Captain and Purser both were on the Franconia 
               about  years ago- as under officers- on a world 
               cruise wer  were on. Both extremely cordial.
               </p>
            <p>
               Took train around noon for Paris. Hot as blazes. 
               and stuffy besides. Had lunch en route.Quite good.
               </p>
            <p>
               Parid and piled our belongings into a cab and 
               landed at Le Br istol- a rather smallish hotel were 
               diplomats go- white marble and mirrors. We had an oval 
               white panneled bedroom and an adjo9ning white panelled 
               round sitting room. (which we didn't need and later gave
               up.)
               </p>
            <p>
               Very weary and after some refreshing 
               tub baths went over to the Crenailliere(nearby) where 
               we had a very delicious dinner.

            <p>
               Took a motor froma travel agency- after breakfast in
               our fancy round sitting room. Drove all around Paris
               the driver named Harvey had a daughter named
               at Waycross Georgia. Went to Lubin's for perfrume
               (had the pink flannel iaffair that Harriet had
               given me- REsented') W alked around the circle-Place
               de Ven6ome To Caron, The Ritz Hotel, and a jewellers
               where I was intregues by a Jewelled bird. But did NOT
               get it! To a very nice resturant in the Bois for lunch
               Le Pre Catalan. Went thento both sides of the Siense
               and got some little prints of Paris. R.R.station and
               Tourist Agency\reg. tickets. We had our evening meal
               at the Bristol and then set out for the Casion deParis.
               Very amusing show- we stayed thro' half of it but felt
               we needed sleep. Gail got a cab by her shrill whistle.'

            <h2>Wednesday, July 20th. LEAVING PARIS FOR SEVERAL DAYS IN THE COUNTRY-
               </h2>
            <p>
               Breakfast in our round white sitting room. Very smartly
               we packed into ONE suit case, leaving all the rest at Le
               Bristol for our return from the country a\few days later.
               Took the noisy little morning train for Tours-about
               2 i/2 hours. We could see several hge chateaux up on THE
               hillsides. Ambroise for one. Just before we reached Tours.
               Mr Dickinson met us. AT- His father was Jo Davidson the famous
               sculptor- and the Davidsons live in the old farm manor-
               house that was his.. We drove to Brech^eron their farm, where
               we had a very substantial lunch- as Mrs. D explained we
               would need it as we had a busy afternoon before us. Sorrel
               soup, steak and a salad. We had a pleAsant room on the
               ground floor a tiny dressing room and a HUGE bath room
               with a tub  large enough for a baby elephant!
               </p>
            <p>
               After breakfastLUNCHEON we started out with Jack Davidson
               in his cosy little car for the "afternoon tour".
               </p>
            <p>
               Went first to Chenoceaux- this chateau we went
               inside of. Lofty hall and rooms with paintings of
               people belonging to the various families connected wi h
               the chateau, many years ago. One of the interesting
                parts of tis particular mansion was the covered bridge
               fRom the fuRther end of the building to the shore on the
               other side. This was built up over the river by a series
               0of arches. An important buildin g was to have been
                errected on the further side of the river connected with
               the bridge. It reminded us of the bridge in Florenc
               e-Ponte Vecchio.
               </p>
            <p>
               From here we drove thro the lovely river valleys
               and above. Three of these rivers.AMbroise we saw from below
               The round tower from the river side was the
               one the riders went up to the stables- on  a ramp insiDe
                the huge tower. The large tower on the other side was
               that used by royalty ,etc;carriages went in this one
               up to an important court. We went inside the parts of
               the castle-absolutely bare rooms- being repaired
               IN the church and a tomb. Saw a chateau or two and
               various churches outide. Then visited Sache, Balkac
               old home- now a museum. An interestint rather tall
               building- not especially large. The medium sized living
               </p>
            <p>
               was furnished exactly as Balzak left it. Wall paper in
               imatation of heavy folds of materiaL with borDers and
               rosetters in a mustard shade. Ratyer gay floWER chitz
               on the chairs and sofa. The view from all the windows very
               lovely.The floor above was his bedroom. A|very small bed
               fitted into an alcove.(such a steep narrow stairway
               to get up to this room) Across the l little hall was father
               a spacious room which/contained a large collection of
               Jo Davidson's work. Almost entirely busts of famous
               people. A life size figure of Gertrude Stien. The busts
               were all arranged on tall swuare pedestals of varying
               The likeness being startlingly fine. We could seee from
               these high windows far over the beautiful rolling hi
               country-and over the tiny villages scattered over the
               fieLDs. Supper Mrs Davidson explained was a very light
               meal - it was excellent Sorrell soup Soufleeland a
               saldd.   In the evenong we went with Jack to see the
               "illumanation" A little way down the roAd at the chateau
               Azay d'Rideau. A heavenly place surrounded by a moat
               filled with water(as it should be!) It was then quite
               dark. People sat about in the ground on rugs- some
               walked about. Beautiful music and a story of a tragic
               happening iN the castle (many years ago) was recited
               from the castly windows. The windows being lit as it
               wouLD ld fit into the story.
               </p>
            <p>
               Thursday July 21st,Breakfast in our room. About I
               I0 we started ^with the Davidsons and theirnlittle boy plus
               a picnic. First to a monestry- Loches - the original
               walls enclosing it. Large wheat fields were within the
               enclosure. The buiodings were of the     century. We
               then drove thro' what was teh royal forrest-came to a
               pretty round thached summer house. As it rained a little we ate our excellent lunch
               at this place.
               </p>
            <p>
               Went back to Loche, the chateau and church.Visited
               the tomb of Agnes Sorel. and went thro' many barren rooms
               in the chateau- one of which Joan of Arc was supposed to
               have had her second audience with the King. At this time
               she was said to have selected him from the large gathering
               (she|never having seen him before)     Rained light
               showers.        Then to chinon- where we had tea and
               walked thro the old vallage.This particular town is HELD
               by the government as to building and changes of any
               sort.(Like Chester in England and rRotherburg in Germany)
               In the evening a couple came for over night. We could
               have managed very nicely without HIM. Very noisy and disagreed with everybody and every thing!
               </p>
            <p>
               July 22nd. Day of departure.Drove to St. Pierre
               de Clochs just outside of Tour- where we took the II.20
               train fro Paris. Mrs Davidsons' Mother drove over with us.
               Her sister lives in the U.S.A at Hanover. The car
               acted up on the way over- but we got there!!
               </p>

               Saturday, July 23, 1955 Now we leave for Paris- not very much of a 
               visit but there is much to see in Europe- and many places
               we may never get around to again' However Paris I hope to
               visit agaiN.

               We left Le Bristol for the AirWAYs a little before 9 and
               stopped enroute at Hermes to collect a scarf-decorated with
               all the famous chateaux of France- a few of which we HAD
               visited during our recent little stay in Tours. This
               scarf a souviener for Gail. Then on to the air port.
               A two-motor plane awaited us (this did not entrane ME)
               Not many passengers. We paid about $6.00over weight- but
               expected this anyway.About 3/4 hour's flight among the
               clouds. A bit bumpy. But we GOT there O.K.

               Mercedes BUcher met us at the Brussels terminal with her
               new grey Ford Sedan. It was good to see her! We always have
               fun. She drove usuto Brussels and thro the lovely parks.
               Landing at the Metropole (where M. alSo lives until her
               apartment\is ready) we wnet up to our rooms. Nothing very
               fancy but quiet. Some flowers arrived from M.G. and Clyde
               and directly After, in they came!They were at the Atlanta
               hotel alMost next door on this busy street. We all / trailed
               over to the GRand Place. Where we had a truly delicious
               meal of steak potoes etc ,on\little table placed out/on the
               sidewalk. This beautiful Place is to me one of the most
               beautiful sigHT have ever seen. It is very large and neatly
               paved with blaocks of stone- as are most of the streets
               in Brussels The distinguished Town Hall(Hotel de Ville)
               occupies practiced the end, facing the lovely group of\Guild houses
               or  Corporation Houses. All around the square are these very
               Beautiful structURes, darkened with age, the carvings and
               cornices etc Decoratee with gold.The facades are sumourount
               by irregular lr roofs topped with emblems of the guilds.
               A baket, a lamP, The|effect at night, whenthe buildings are
               wonderfully l illumanated, is something never to be
               forgotten.

               again for ouR Beloved Square where we had a delicious
