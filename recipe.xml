    <title>Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe.</title>
    <intro>This recipe comes from <origin>MS Codex 625</origin>, a manuscript recipe book that
        belonged to a student in a <location>London</location> cooking school in the early
            <date>eighteenth century</date>. The pastry school was owned by Edward Kidder, who
        taught at a few locations in London between around <date>1720 and 1734</date>. Blank books
        with printed title pages seem to have been used by students to write down recipes they
        learned. Kidder also published his recipes in the printed volume, <cookbook>Receipts for
            Pastry and Cookery</cookbook>, in <date>1720</date>. </intro>
    <assemble>Take <ing>a pound of fresh butter</ing>

        the original)</assemble>
    <materials>
        <ing measurement="0.5 lb.">1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, softened</ing>
        <ing measurement="0.5 lb.">1/2 lb. sugar</ing>
        <ing measurement="0.25 tsp.">1/4 tsp. mace</ing>
        <ing measurement="0.5 tsp.">1/2 tsp. cinnamon with 5 cups <unknown>hamsters</unknown></ing>
        <ing>2 eggs</ing>
        <ing measurement="0.75 lb.">3/4 lb. flour </ing>
    </materials>
    <combine>
        <step part="one">Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar.</step>
        <step part="two">Then add the eggs and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. </step>
        <step part="three">Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined. </step>
        <step part="four">Scoop and roll the dough by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat.</step>
        <step part="optional">[You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s firm enough to roll
            out on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.]</step>
    </combine>
    <finale>Bake at <temp>350F</temp> for <duration>15-18 minutes</duration>
        <note advice="optional">(ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them thinner and have
            a slightly shorter cooking time).</note> They’re done once they turn the slightest bit
        brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded about <total>two dozen
        cookies.</total></finale>
    <extra>The Results If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these. We added the
        <ing>cinnamon</ing> because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out the mace
        nicely. These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea. We rolled and patted
        the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick to roll out, but a
        little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge might make the dough easier to work with a
        rolling pin.</extra>
